    "## Hackathon Turtle Time\n",
    "\n",
    "This hackathon is open to anyone, any major. In this hackathon, you will be experimenting with a fun turtle environment -- navigating mazes, drawing designs, and if you want, hacking the internals to create new mazes or change the animal to something else.  You'll be using Python and Google CoLab and practicing strong programming fundamentals here (loops, lists, if/else statements, and functions).  In terms of assumed knowledge, as long as you know some basic Python, you should be able to participate. We will provide instructions to set up Google Colab, but if you want, you can do that ahead of time."
