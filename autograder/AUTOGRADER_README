### Autograder steps... for all steps, replace # with the number of the homework
1. Login to Canvas
2. Go to CS108L Course

### Download Student Submissions
3. Click on Assignments -> Weekly Assignments -> Homework #
4. Click 'Download Submissions' at bottom of screen
5. Move downloaded submissions into hw# folder

### Download gradebook CSV file
6. Click on 'Grades'
7. Search Assignment Name (e.g. 'Homework 0') in 'Search Assignments' box
8. Click Export -> Export Current Gradebook View
   (this will export only the visible columns)
9. Move downloaded csv file to hw# folder, change name to hw#_grades.csv

### Run autograder
10. Go into hw# folder
11. Create a hw#_grader.py file, based on a previous example.
    - Note: need to create new  test_**  functions,
       -- Each test function should do an `assert` at the end
       -- Test functions can do things before the assert, like load a turtle from file and run checks
    - Note: the lines in __main__ need to be adapted for each homework
    - Note: should update the `TestHomework#` function name

12. Run `python3 hw#_grader.py`
    - This updates the hw#_grades.csv to include updated grades for the assignment based on which
      autograder tests pass.  This can be imported to canvas (Grades->import) to update student grades.
    - This will also create a file hw#_feedback.csv which contains feedback for each student stating
      which tests failed.  This feedback would need to be manually added to student canvas submissions.

Notes:
Two odd cases will generate "Tests that failed" in feedback.csv
- Files that end in .py.py will do this 
- Files that carry out the required tasks and pass the tests, but generate an error at the end will do this
