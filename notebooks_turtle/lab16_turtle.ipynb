    "1. Class Definition Review \n",
    "   - Class (less formal): Is a collection of related information and related functions.  The information can be numbers, words, lists and really anything.  \n",
    "       - The functions and information are typically related around a concept, like a circle class or turtle class\n",
    "       - The class defines how these functions and information interrelated, how they are structured\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - Class (more formal definition): is a code template for creating objects and providing initial (default) values for member variables and default member function\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object Definition Review\n",
    "    - Object:  An object is an instance of a class.  \n",
    "    - An object is an instantiation, realization, embodiment of the class \n",
    "    - You can create multiple objects for the same class, for instance you could have 5 different circles, all objects based on the same class.  Each circle could have a different radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Member Functions and Variables Review\n",
    "    - Classes can contain both variables and also functions\n",
    "    - These are called member variables and member functions"

    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance: the process of creating a new class based on a previous, pre-existing class\n",
    "   - The new class will inherit or keep all of the existing member variables and member functions from the previous, pre-existing class\n",
    "   - But, the new class will add something new, or different, so that the new class is different than the parent class\n",
    "   - For instance, the parent class could be a rectangle, and the child class could be a square\n",

    "2. Parent class: this is the previous, pre-existing clss\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Child class: this is the new class, and is based on the parent class\n",
    "   - The child class inherits all of the existing member varaibles and member functions from the parent class\n",
    "   - However, the child class can overwrite, or re-define member variables and member functions, so that they are different from the parent class\n",
